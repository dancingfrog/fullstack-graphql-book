# Chapter Two Exercise Solutions

## Exercise 1

> Consider the other requirements of our business reviews application. Can you write GraphQL queries to address these requirements? What are the results?


## Exercise 2

> What other fields should make use of pagination and ordering in our API? Update the type definitions to include the appropriate ordering and pagination fields and update the resolvers to handle these pagination arguments.

## Exercise 3

> Implement the root-level resolver for `usersById`.

## Exercise 4

> Our example GraphQL API conspicuously lacks business categories. Update the sample data, GraphQL type definitions, and resolvers to take advantage of business categories. Consider how you would model categories in the API given that searching by category was specifically identified as a business requirement.
